**Modify caching rules**

- Folder caching rules: Folder must begin with ‘/’, e.g. "/pic", "/doc", "/htdoc/data", caching rules will apply to all sub folders.
- File caching rules: Use common suffix, e.g. "jpg", "png", "gif", "txt", "m4v", "mp3", caching rules will apply to all files with set suffix under specified folder.
- Caching order: Caching rules follow first-set, first apply.

**Access Control Management**

Can configure Referer Block List and Allowed List to achieve anti-stealing link.
Each rule applies to both folder and files, e.g. all png files under /*.png.
Block list: when Referer is in block list, access is denied. Otherwise can do.
Allow list: only when Referer is in allow list, access is allowed. Otherwise, access denied.

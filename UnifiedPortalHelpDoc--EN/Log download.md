##Log Format
Logs are stored as blobs under the container named "cdn-access-logs" and each blob is a Gzipped CSV file. See details below:

 - c-ip: client IP address
 - timestamp: access time
 - cs-method: HTTP requested actions, e.g.GET method.
 - cs-uri-stem: the Universal Resource Identifier, or target, of the action.
 - http-ver: HTTP protocol version
 - sc-status: Protocol Status, the HTTP or FTP status code.
 - sc-bytes: the number of bytes that the server sent. 
 - c-referer: client referer
 - c-user-agent: client user agent
 - rs-durations(ms): request time (ms)
 - hit-miss: CDN cache hit/miss ID
 - s-ip: Server IP Address, the IP address of the server on which the log file entry was generated.

**Note** Those empty fields will be set to "-", e.g. "c-referer". Also, depending on edge server settings, "rs-duration","hit-miss","s-ip"ã€€may also be empty.

**Note** After CDN is enabled, most page visits are from CDN edge servers.The real client IP address is recorded in the HTTP header **X-FOrwarded For**. Please adjust the log configuration of your web server if you need this information. Here is an example for Nginx:

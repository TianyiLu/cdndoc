Logs are stored as blob under blob container "cdn-access-logs" and each blob is Gzipped as CSV file. See details below:

 - c-ip: client IP address
 - timestamp: access time
 - cs-method: HTTP requested actions, e.g.GET method.
 - cs-uri-stem: the Universal Resource Identifier, or target, of the action.
 - http-ver: HTTP protocol version
 - sc-status: Protocol Status, the HTTP or FTP status code.
 - sc-bytes: the number of bytes that the server sent. 
 - c-referer: client referer
 - c-user-agent: client user agent
 - rs-durations(ms): request time (ms)
 - hit-miss: CDN cache hit/miss ID
 - s-ip: Server IP Address, the IP address of the server on which the log file entry was generated.

**Note** If logs do not have values for above listed items, they will be set to "-", e.g. "c-referer". Also, depending on edge point settings, "rs-duration","hit-miss","s-ip"ã€€may also be null.

**Note** After CDN acceleration, all visit records are from CDN edge points. If you want to know customer IP address, please refer to below.

When CDN goes to origin domain, it will add origin IP address to **X-FOrwarded For** in HTTP Header, and Web server of origin domain will add this to log.

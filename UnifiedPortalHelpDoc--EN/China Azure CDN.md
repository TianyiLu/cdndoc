#China Azure CDN
The Windows Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) caches Windows Azure blobs and static content used by cloud services at strategically placed locations across China to provide maximum bandwidth for delivering content to users. China Azure CDN also support origin domains that are not deployed on Azure platform.

You can create a CDN endpoint for a storage account, in order to cache blob data, or for a cloud service, in order to cache static content used by the service. When you create the endpoint, you must provide your custom domain and related ICP number. The Windows Azure Management Portal provides you with a unique URL for accessing your cached content, but you need to create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points from your custom domain to this URL. This URL maps to the origin domain, which is the storage account or cloud service on which you created the endpoint. 

##Create CDN Endpoint

1.	Go to Windows Azure CDN, choose CDN and click ‘NEW’’, Click QUICK CREATE.
2.	Choose ‘Acceleration Type’, currently China Azure CDN support Web Acceleration, Download Acceleration and VOD Acceleration. 
3.	Choose ‘Origin Domain Type’, currently we have support 4 options, Cloud Service, Storage Account, Web App and Custom Origin Domain
4.	Type in or choose Origin Domain, select an origin domain under selected Origin Domain Type in last step.
5.	In ‘Custom Domain’, type the custom domain you are about to use.
6.	For ‘ICP Number’, type in the mapping ICP number with above custom domain.

###Disable or Delete CDN Endpoint
To stop caching content on a CDN endpoint, you can disable the endpoint. When the endpoint is disabled, content cached by the CDN on that endpoint is not available to users, and the application will need to provide that content from the origin domain, until the endpoint is enabled again.
If you wish to stop caching content on the endpoint altogether, you can delete the endpoint.

Each rule applies to both folder and files. E.g. all png files under /*.png.
Block list: when Referer is in block list, access is denied. Otherwise can do.
Allow list: only when Referer is in allow list, access is allowed. Otherwise, access denied.
